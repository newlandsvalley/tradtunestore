       <h2>Why should I register?</h2>
       <p>You don't have to register to search for tunes, to see their scores and comments or to play them.  But you do need to register if you wish to submit a 
       new tune or add a comment.  When you register, you will need to supply a user name and an email address.  We will keep your email address secret and will
       not spam you.  Once you send your details, you will be sent an email with a link which you must click on to finish the registration
       process.  Then you will be able to log in.
       </p>
       <h2>Which genres are supported?</h2>
       <p>At the moment, TradTuneDB recognises Irish, Scottish, Scandinavian and klezmer tunes.  These are kept in separate collections and when you choose 
       a particular genre in a tune search, this is used as the default until you decide to change it.  Each tune has a distinct name (consisting of the
       tune name and its genre) which is used in its URL.  Also, each tune must have a key signature and a rhythm (the tune type).
       The rhythms available are appropriate for the genre (so, for example, Irish tunes use jigs, reels etc. whilst Scandi tunes use polska, g책ngl책t etc.).  You
       can optionally use the keys or the rhythms when searching for tunes. The search dropdowns show the rhythms and keys that are supported for each genre.
       If you want to, you can also use an advanced search where (for example) you can look
       for a particular sequence of notes. 
       </p>
       <h2>How do I submit a tune?</h2>
       <p>This is slightly more complicated.  You must, of course, first log in. Tunes are submitted in <a href='http://abcnotation.com/'>ABC notation</a> which
       is a pure text format consisting of a set of headers describing the tune followed by the notes which are for the most part represented by the letters A to G. 
       So the first problem is to get hold of an ABC file that defines your tune.  Nowadays there are a good many traditional music web sites that allow you to
       download an ABC file.  You could, perhaps, do this so that you can then play the tune in TradTuneDb.
       </p>
       <p>If you choose to do this, there are one or two things to be wary of.  Firstly, make sure the ABC file only contains a single tune (TradTuneDB doesn't
       allow you to upload multiple tunes from the same file).  Make sure that the basic set of tune headers are present.  These are:
    
         <table class="textalign">
           <tr><td>T</td><td>Title</td><td>e.g. T:Polska fran H채lleforsn채s</td></tr>
           <tr><td>K</td><td>Key</td><td>e.g. K:Amin</td></tr>
           <tr><td>R</td><td>Rhythm</td><td>e.g. R: Polska</td></tr>
         </table>
         <br />
       
       Notice that here the tune has a non-ASCII title - you will need to use a Unicode-aware text editor to enter such names properly.  Make sure that the
       key and the genre is supported by TradTuneDB. ABC notation offers quite a lot of sophistication 
       in representing the tune's score (such as chords, harmonies, ornamentation and so on).  However, it is usually 
       best if you don't use these features if you want to hear the tune played clearly - just use tunes with a single melody line.
       </p>
       <p>If you can't find a ready-made ABC file, you will have to build one yourself from scratch.  This usually means you first have to transcribe the
       tune and then conversion to ABC notes is a largely mechanical process.  There are good <a href='http://abcnotation.com/learn'>ABC tutorials</a> 
       to help you to do this. It should have the file extension <em>.abc</em>.
       </p>
       <p>Now you've got your ABC file, you can try to upload it to TradTuneDB.  Firstly, make sure you are logged in and that you are using your intended genre. 
       Then, you can either use the <em>new tune</em> form and paste the ABC into the form field, or you can use the <em>upload</em> option where you enter the location 
       of the ABC file on your file system. If the ABC checks out OK, the system immediately shows you the tune's page, allowing you to see the score and hear it.
       You may find that the tune doesn't look or sound quite right and you'd like to tweak the notes a little. To do this, navigate to the ABC page for the
       tune and delete the tune.  You can then edit your ABC and re-submit it.  You can do this as many times as you like until you are happy with your
       transcription.  Alternatively, the new tune page has a button labelled 'try it out' which allows you to look at the score but doesn't save the tune
       to the database.  Again you can keep trying with edited versions of the tune until you are happy with the score and can submit it.
       </p>
       <h2>How do I submit a comment?</h2>
       <p>Comments are intended to hold additional information about each tune.  They are particularly useful if you find a YouTube video of the tune 
       or perhaps a link to a recording.  Again, you have to log in before you can submit a comment.  Once on the tune page, click on the comments link
       and fill in the form at the foot of the page.  In the case of YouTube URLs, the best thing to do is to embed the video by 
       <a href='https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780?hl=en-GB'>following these instructions</a> and then copy the code 
       they provide into the text. Comments should normally be in plain text but may include URLs - these are expanded to links when the comment
       is submitted and this is true, too, for YouTube <em>watch</em> URLs that you see in the browser address bar. We will attempt to embed the player into the 
       page at a standard size, but this method is less reliable than using YouTube's own embedded links.
       </p>
       <p> If you are not happy with a comment that you have submitted, you can later edit or delete it.  You can also 'try it out' to see what the comment 
       will eventually look like before finally  committing it to the comment list.  
       </p>

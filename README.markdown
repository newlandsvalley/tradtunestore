TradTuneStore
=============

This is the web interface into the [musicrest](https://github.com/newlandsvalley/musicrest) web service and also to the [miditoabc](https://github.com/newlandsvalley/miditoabc) transcoding service. It allows users to submit traditional tunes in [ABC notation](http://abcnotation.com/), to search for these tunes, and, having found them, to download the scores in a variety of formats or to play them - see [tradtunedb](http://www.tradtunedb.org.uk/). This version uses the  [MIDI.js](http://mudcu.be/midi-js/) player which plays midi files fetched from the web service (previous versions used HTML5 audio tags to play wav files). The miditoabc service attempts to convert midi files into abc files which can, of course, then be loaded as normal.

It uses the [Play Framework](http://www.playframework.org/) and is written in Scala.

Current version: 1.1.0

Configuration
-------------

There are two configuration files which are standard for Play applications.  Firstly, the  _routes_ file which associates requests with actions and secondly _application.conf_ for the application itself. The only application-specific settings here are references to the a working directory for transcoding and to the _musicrest_ web service which is used to attempt to produce scores from valid ABC:

      # tradtunestore specific configurations      
      data.home="/var/data/midi2abc"
      musicrest.server="www.tradtunedb.org.uk:8080/musicrest/"
      musicrest.username="midi2abc"
      musicrest.password="changeit"


Dependencies
------------
